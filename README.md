My Progress Bar
This project is a simple React application that displays a progress bar and allows the user to input a percentage to adjust the width of the progress bar dynamically.

Usage
Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will see a progress bar with an input field where you can enter a percentage to adjust the width of the progress bar.
